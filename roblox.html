    <h2>Roblox: Not As Safe As It Seems</h2>
    <p>
      I’ve met two predators on Roblox — one from Canada and one from my own country, Indonesia.
      Roblox says it’s for kids, but its moderation tells another story.

    <h3>What I've Witnessed</h3>

    <div class="cards">

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Predator Encounters</h4>
        <p>
          I was approached by strangers in private messages pretending to be kids. I blocked them,
          but Roblox did nothing — they stayed online, free to talk to others.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Moderation Failure</h4>
        <p>
          Even after reporting with evidence, moderation ignored it. Their filter blocks words, not people.
          Dangerous users slip through easily.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Exploits & Unsafe Games</h4>
        <p>
          I've seen games that bypass filters with inappropriate content. Some mimic popular games
          to trick kids. These stay online for weeks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>False Sense of Security</h4>
        <p>
          Roblox advertises as safe for kids, but in reality, danger hides in plain sight — from chatrooms
          to sponsored games with poor oversight.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h4>Neglected Reports</h4>
        <p>
          Reports take days, often never reviewed. I’ve tested this by reporting obvious abuse.
          No response. It’s like shouting into the void.
