# 📢 GEXPOSE — Legal Protection & Rights

Gexpose is a digital awareness project I created under **Gcreation**. Its purpose is to expose unsafe content, poor moderation, and dangerous behavior on platforms such as **Roblox**, **VRChat**, and **Discord**. This document explains how, as the creator from **Indonesia**, I am protected by international human rights, national laws, and digital expression principles around the world.

## 🌐 I Am From Indonesia — But My Rights Are Global

Although I live in **Indonesia**, my digital voice is protected globally. My right to speak, inform, and warn others is supported by:

---

## 🇮🇩 INDONESIAN LAW — UU ITE (Electronic Information and Transactions Law)

I respect and follow Indonesian law by:
- Avoiding personal attacks, defamation, or fake content
- Sharing truthful and helpful information
- Protecting digital privacy (not revealing names or personal data)

My content follows Article 28(1) and Article 26 of UU ITE, which support responsible public communication and privacy.

## 🇺🇸 U.S. LAW — Platforms Based in the United States

Platforms like Roblox, VRChat, and Discord are based in the U.S. My right to criticize them is protected by:

- **First Amendment (Freedom of Expression)**
- **Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act** — which protects platforms from user content, but also allows users like me to speak openly about platform failures.

I am legally allowed to say:
> “Roblox failed to protect me from predators.”  
> “VRChat includes adult content that is not filtered.”  
> “Discord allows NSFW servers that can harm young users.”

As long as I speak honestly and respectfully, I am within legal and ethical bounds.

## 🌍 INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW

As a global citizen and youth voice:

- **Universal Declaration of Human Rights – Article 19** gives me the right to express my opinions freely through any media.
- **UN Convention on the Rights of the Child – Article 13** protects my right to seek, receive, and share information to promote safety and awareness.

These rights do not depend on what country I’m from — they are international.

## 📜 Disclaimer

All content on Gexpose is based on my personal experiences, public sources, and opinion. I do not intend to harm, defame, or mislead any individual or company. I do not host or link to harmful, illegal, or explicit content.

---

## ✅ Summary

As a creator from **Indonesia**, I am protected by:
- Indonesian law when I follow truth and privacy principles
- U.S. law when I speak about platforms based there
- International human rights when I use my voice to protect others

I built Gexpose not to attack, but to **warn**, **educate**, and **protect**.
